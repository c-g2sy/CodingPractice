# CodingPractice
Bash scripts and language scripts from tutorials

HTML learning from freecodecamp.org

Various tools that I write as walkthroughs from tutorial sites will end up in here

I will try my best to comment my code and keep everything evolving as I learn new skills

I guess I need to learn markdown as well...
